how do you do IDs. what am I missing?

recurring, how do?

delete event

add_event I did not do this, is this necessary for the programme to actually work? I don't think I actually added the event properly.

must you import datetime? I used the datetime time date picker thing without importing
    - to use the date time as anything other than a strings. as python it works as an actual datetime and you can order as date.

IN SOLUTION CODE:
  recurring = True if 'recurring' in request.form else False
  # sets recurring to true if the recurring string can be found. means the tickbox has been ticked. intsead. set up:      
  #   <label for="recurring">Recurring?</label>
      # <input type="checkbox" name="recurring" id="recurring" value="False">
      # SET TO TRUE. 

1. from flask import render_template, request, redirect
return redirect('/events')
    # redirect MEANS you don't have to create a new template
